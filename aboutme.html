<h1>This is my About Me Page!</h1>
<p>Hi!</p> My name is Bella Kennedy-Cummings I am 16 years old and I am a junior. I love to play tennis on my free time and also build robots. Building robots is my passion, I started building robots in 7th grade when my mom made it a class at my school. After I graduate high school I would like to join the NAVY, but im still double thinking because I also want to become an engineer. I am the youngest of six kids and to be honest people say "well you never get bored" but honestly I do because I am around four to five years younger from them and I don't understand them or their jokes sometimes. This school year I plan on focusing in school and passing all my classes.
